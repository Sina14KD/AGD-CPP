### Using the AGD Algorithm

To use the AGD algorithm, create the `nodes_list` (vertices of the search area) following these rules:

1. The first node should be the vertex on the longest edge with the minimum X-coordinate.  
2. The nodes should be listed in counterclockwise order around the polygon.
